# 30zerm cut-up bot

This is a basic port of [@30zerMbot's](https://twitter.com/30zerMbot). The original code wasn't meant for cut-up in Persian. so with a few changes it now works as a cut-up bot on twitter.

This project should work in the latest releases of Python 2.7 and Python 3. By default, in Heroku, this will be deployed to Python 3.


## Credit
This is based almost entirely on [@harrisj's](https://twitter.com/harrisj) [iron_ebooks](https://github.com/harrisj/iron_ebooks/). He created it in Ruby, and I wanted to port it to Python. All the credit goes to him. As a result, all of the blame for clunky implementation in Python fall on me.

Many thanks to the many folks who have contributed to the development of this project since it was open sourced in 2013. If you see ways to improve the code, please fork it and send a [pull request](https://github.com/tommeagher/heroku_ebooks/pulls), or [file an issue](https://github.com/tommeagher/heroku_ebooks/issues) for me, and I'll address it.
