# 30zerm cut-up bot

This is a basic port of [@30zerMbot's](https://twitter.com/30zerMbot). The original code wasn't meant for cut-up in Persian. so with a few changes it now works as a cut-up bot on twitter.

This project should work in the latest releases of Python 2.7 and Python 3. By default, in Heroku, this will be deployed to Python 3.
